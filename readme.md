# RN GitHub Users

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)


An example project implemented in **React Native**.
It uses mostly: **redux**, **lottie**, **mocha**, **detox**, **GraphQL** and other...

In the app you can look for GitHub users and list their repositories.
Informations are presented in two screens.

# Before you start

* Install packages by `npm install`.
* App uses [GitHub GraphQL API](https://developer.github.com/v4/ "GitHub GraphQL API"). Use the following steps to get access to it: 
 * generate a token at <https://github.com/settings/tokens>,
 * make a new file `token.js` with the contents of `default.token.js`,
 * insert your token inside the new `token.js` file.
* App is ready to start! ðŸŽ‰


# What is missing

 - persistent storage usage,
 - **Flow** or **TypeScript** usage,
 - pagination of query results,
